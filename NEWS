Version 1.0.1

BUGS

* Fixed bug where Roxygen example for serializePackage() was writing to the "/tmp" 
  directory
  
* Serializing system metadata to XML with serializeSystemMetadata() now gathers all
  <permission> elements together for a <subject> so that the subject does not appear
  under multiple <allow> elements.
